**List of enumerable methods remade:**
* each
* each-with-index
* select
* all?
* any?
* none?
* count
* map
* inject


Overall I found this easier than the bubble_sort. I don't know why, as bubble 
sort seems to be a very simple sorting algorithm. I learned a lot about
procs and blocks from remaking some of the methods that Ruby uses. While I'm not
the best programmer I understand how valuable the each method is, and may
even try to use it when I start learning Python.
